A gRPC service intended as a backend for an LLM that can run arbitrary pieces of Python code.

Built from the ground up to be safe and reproducible.

---

## ü™ë Local set-up

Pre-requisites:
- `git`
- `docker` (we recommend using [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/))
- `grpcurl` (optional -- for testing)
- `python` 3.12+

### Clone this repo

This project contains submodules. Be sure to clone it with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or initialize the submodules later with `git submodule update --init`.

### Prepare environment

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
poetry install
```

### üöÄ Run

Run the server using:

```bash
poe compose-up
```

üéâ Bee Code Interpreter should now be running in the background! You can test it using `grpcurl`:

```bash
grpcurl -d '{"executor_id":"1","source_code":"print(\"hello world\")"}' -plaintext -max-time 60 127.0.0.1:50051 code_interpreter.v1.CodeInterpreterService/Execute
```

Stop the server using:

```bash
poe compose-down
```

---

## üì£ Publishing

```shell
poe publish $NEW_VERSION
```

## üß≥ Production set-up

All configuration options are defined and described in `src/code_interpreter/config.py`. You can override them using environment variables with `APP_` prefix, eg. `APP_EXECUTOR_IMAGE` to override `executor_image`.

For a production setup, ensure that you have the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster with a secure container runtime (gVisor, Kata Containers, Firecracker, etc.)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker containers are not fully sandboxed by default. To protect from malicious attackers, do not skip this step.
- A service account, bound to the pod where `bee-code-interpreter` is running, with permissions to manage pods in the namespace it is configured to use.
  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Bee Code Interpreter automatically uses a pod service account where available.
- The cluster must have the executor image available (either from a registry, or built from `./executor` in this repo).
- You may check the usability of the cluster using `python -m code_interpreter.kubernetes_check`.
- You may check the health of the local service using `python -m code_interpreter.health_check`.
