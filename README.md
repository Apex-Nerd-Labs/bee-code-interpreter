A HTTP service intended as a backend for an LLM that can run arbitrary pieces of Python code.

Built from the ground up to be safe and reproducible.

> [!NOTE]
> This project contains submodules. Be sure to clone it with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or initialize the submodules later with `git submodule update --init`.

## ü™ë Local set-up

It is possible to quickly spin up Bee Code Interpreter locally. It is not necessary to have Python or Poetry set up for this, since all is done using Docker.

1. Consider using [Bee Stack](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack), which sets up everything (including Bee Code Interpreter) for you. Alternatively, to develop using Bee Agent Framework, you may use [Bee Framework Starter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework-starter). Only follow the rest of this guide if you don't want to run the full stack, or need to make some modifications to Bee Code Interpreter (like modifying the executor image).
2. Install [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) -- a local Docker and Kubernetes distribution.
> [!WARNING]
> If you use a different local Docker / Kubernetes environment than Rancher Desktop, you may have a harder time.
> Most of the other options (like Podman Desktop) require an additional step to make locally built images available in Kubernetes.
> In that case, you might want to check `scripts/run-pull.sh` and modify it accordingly.
3. If you already use `kubectl` to manage Kubernetes clusters, ensure that you have the correct context selected in `kubectl`.
4. Run one of the following commands to spin up Bee Code Interpreter in the active `kubectl` context:
    - **Use a pre-built image** (recommended if you made no changes): `bash scripts/run-pull.sh`
    - **Build image locally**: `bash scripts/run-build.sh`
> [!WARNING]
> Building the image locally make take a long time -- up to a few hours on slower machines.
5. Once the service is running, you can interact with it using the HTTP API described below.

## üì° HTTP API Reference

The service exposes the following HTTP endpoints:

### Execute Code

Executes arbitrary Python code in a sandboxed environment. All `import`s are checked and missing libraries are installed on-the-fly. `file_hash` refers to the hash-based filename as used in the storage folder.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/execute`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "source_code": string,
    "files": {
        "file_path": "file_hash"
    },
    "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
    }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "stdout": string,
    "stderr": string,
    "exit_code": number,
    "files": {
        "file_path": "file_hash"
    }
}
```

### Parse Custom Tool

Parses a custom tool definition and returns its metadata.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/parse-custom-tool`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "tool_source_code": string
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "tool_name": string,
    "tool_input_schema_json": string,
    "tool_description": string
}
```

### Execute Custom Tool

Executes a custom tool with provided input.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/execute-custom-tool`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "tool_source_code": string,
    "tool_input_json": string, // a string-encoded JSON object
    "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
    }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "tool_output_json": string
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
    "stderr": string
}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
# Execute a simple Python script
curl -X POST http://localhost:50081/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_code":"print(\"hello world\")"}'
```

## üß≥ Production setup

All configuration options are defined and described in `src/code_interpreter/config.py`. You can override them using environment variables with `APP_` prefix, e.g. `APP_EXECUTOR_IMAGE` to override `executor_image`.

For a production setup, ensure that you have the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster with a secure container runtime (gVisor, Kata Containers, Firecracker, etc.)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker containers are not fully sandboxed by default. To protect from malicious attackers, do not skip this step.
- A service account, bound to the pod where `bee-code-interpreter` is running, with permissions to manage pods in the namespace it is configured to use.
- The cluster must have the executor image available (either from a registry, or built from `./executor` in this repo).
- You may check the health of the local service using `python -m code_interpreter.health_check`.
- The shared folder with file objects should be periodically cleaned of old objects. The objects are identified by random ids and may be removed as soon as the consumer is done downloading them. If the objects are shared through a S3 bucket, we recommend setting up an auto-deletion policy.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

#### Install dependencies:

Use [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install dependencies: `mise install`.

If you don't want to use `mise`, look into the file `.mise.toml` and install the listed dependencies however you see fit.

Afterwards, install the project dependencies using `poetry install`.

#### Run end-to-end tests:

``` bash
# in 1st terminal (Bee Code Interpreter must be running for end-to-end tests to work):
poe run

# in 2nd terminal:
poe test
```

#### Publish a new version:

```shell
VERSION=...
git checkout main
git pull
poetry version $VERSION
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v$VERSION"
git tag v$VERSION
git push origin main v$VERSION
```
